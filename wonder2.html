    <h1>Pyramids of Giza</h1>
    <p>Who built them
        The pyramids were built by the rulers Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure over three generations during the Old Kingdom, Egypt's first great era. 
         
        Purpose
        The pyramids were royal tombs built to display the power of the pharaohs. 
         
        Size
        The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest of the three pyramids, standing at 454 ft (138.5 m) tall. The other two pyramids are the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure. 
         
        Construction
        The pyramids were built using ramps, sledges, ropes, rollers, and levers. The Great Pyramid was built with an estimated 2.3 million stone blocks, some weighing as much as 15,000 lbs. 
         
        Orientation
        The sides of the pyramids are oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass within a small fraction of a degree. 
         
        Preservation
        The British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie established protocols for preserving ancient monuments in Egypt, which are still used today. 
         
        Location
        The pyramids are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis". 
         
        Historical significance
        The pyramids are one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and are the last remaining wonder.</p>
