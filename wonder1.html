    <h1> The great wall of china</h1>
    <p>Size
        The Great Wall of China is a series of walls and fortifications that stretches over 21,196.18 kilometers (13,170 miles) across 15 regions of northern China. The average height of the wall is 7.8 meters (25.6 feet) and the width is 4-5 meters (13-16 feet) wide at the top. 
         
        Construction
        The Great Wall was built over a period of more than 2,000 years, starting with the remnants of ancient walls and fortifications and ending during the Ming Dynasty. The wall was built using a variety of materials including packed earth, clay, granite, marble, and bricks. 
         
        Purpose
        The Great Wall was built to protect China from invading forces and to help with trade routes. 
         
        UNESCO World Heritage Site
        The Great Wall of China was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. 
         
        Sections
        Some of the main sections of the Great Wall include Badaling, Mutianyu, Simatai, and Jinshanling. 
         
        Visibility from space
        The Great Wall is not visible from the moon, as was previously claimed. Astronaut Yang Liwei confirmed this during the first Chinese space flight in 2003.</p>
